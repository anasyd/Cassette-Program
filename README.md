# Cassette Recording Program

This repository contains a simple Python program developed in 2019 to record cassette tapes. While the program is not extensive or particularly polished, it holds deep sentimental value as it's tied to cherished family memories encapsulated in cassette tapes. These tapes exchanged between my grandfather, who worked abroad, and my mother and their siblings served as a lifeline for communication.

## Features

- Records cassette tapes for a specified duration.
- Aims to preserve precious family connections through automation.

## Disclaimer

This program is a personal project developed during my early programming journey. It may not be extensively tested or optimized for all environments. However, it serves as a testament to my passion for coding and my commitment to preserving cherished family memories.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own needs.
